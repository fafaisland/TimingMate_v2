TimingMate_v2
=============

I create it and use it to finish my tasks effectively. I set an allowed time to finish for a task. Like I plan to use 3 hours to finish my Deception Detection project. Every time I do the project, I set a Timer. It is just like a smaller goal for today maybe 30 mins which makes me focus on the task.  PS: I just redo and redesign the app  a few days before. Some of the functionalities are not implemented and the UI isn't good. The new version of the app is based on user testing for the previous version. I plan to use another week to polish it.
